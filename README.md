# Math Solution by Gesture

An interactive and engaging way for children to study mathematics using hand gestures. This project enables users to draw numbers and mathematical symbols in the air using their fingers, which are detected via OpenCV. The recognized expressions are then solved quickly using Gemini AI, making it easier to work with complex mathematical symbols like matrices, theta (Î¸), alpha (Î±), and more.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Uses OpenCV to detect and track hand movements for drawing numbers and symbols in the air.
- **Real-time Expression Solving**: Gemini AI processes and solves mathematical expressions instantly.
- **Supports Complex Symbols**: Easily recognizes and solves matrices, Greek symbols (Î¸, Î±, Î², etc.), and other mathematical notations.
- **Interactive Learning**: Makes math learning more fun and intuitive for children.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10.5
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Google Gemini AI API

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/R17358/Math-solution-by-gesture.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
